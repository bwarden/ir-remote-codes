# ir-remote-codes
Collection of IR remote codes as gathered from real devices

Codes are stored under the `codes/` directory, with one file per protocol, where protocol names are taken from the [IRremoteESP8266](https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266/blob/master/SupportedProtocols.md#send--decodable-protocols) project.
